It's just a personal website. Not sure what you want me to put here. Feel free to browse the file structure, or to look at any of the assets.  There might be a couple of easter eggs hidden in here :)


CURRENT ISSUES TO DEAL WITH

- Fix website height.  10% + 80% + 10% != 100% apparently.
- Title animation: do it
- Do logos
- Figure out what to put in the menu
